This "guide" reads like a textbook, not a story. It's a dry, clinical list of advice, devoid of any real-life emotion or the raw struggle of a long-distance relationship. It's a "tell, don't show" approach, leaving the reader cold and unmoved.

Here's a breakdown of the problems:

**1. Lack of Narrative:**

* **No characters, no story:**  There's no sense of two people actually navigating a long-distance relationship. The reader never connects to the emotional ups and downs, the fights, the longing, the small victories.
* **Generic advice:**  Instead of specific scenarios, we get vague bullet points: "Exploring alternative ways to feel connected," "Finding creative solutions for consistent communication." These are meaningless without real examples.

**2. Awful Dialogue:**

* **No dialogue whatsoever:**  Dialogue is crucial for showing the emotional nuances of a relationship. How do the characters actually communicate? How do they fight? How do they express their love and longing? This complete absence of dialogue is crippling.

**3. Uninspired Structure:**

* **Boring, predictable chapters:**  The chapters are formulaic and predictable. "Building Trust," "Maintaining Connection," "Overcoming Challenges," etc.  These headings are lifeless and don't spark any curiosity.
* **Lack of flow:** The writing feels choppy and disjointed. It lacks a narrative thread that weaves the various points together.

**4. Avoidable Cliches:**

* **Overused phrases:** "Communication is key," "Trust is the cornerstone," "Bridging the gap" -  these are tired cliches that add nothing to the content.
* **Generic advice:**  The advice is so generic it could apply to any relationship, not just long-distance. The author needs to show what makes long-distance relationships unique. 

**What the author needs to do:**

* **Write a story:**  Create two characters (or even a single character) and tell their story. Show the challenges they face, the fights they have, the moments of joy and longing. 
* **Use dialogue:**  Write out conversations, capturing the nuances of communication, the silences, the awkward moments, the tender moments.
* **Create engaging scenes:**  Instead of listing advice, describe specific situations: a video call where they get into a fight, a surprise visit, a first meeting after months apart.
* **Go deeper:**  Explore the emotional impact of long-distance. How does it change their lives? How do they cope with loneliness and insecurity? How does their relationship evolve?

**Imagine this instead:**

* A scene where a couple has a video call while one of them is eating dinner alone, feeling isolated and lonely.
* A dialogue where they argue about their different expectations for their next visit. 
* A description of how they use a shared playlist to feel connected even when they can't be together.

This is just a starting point. The author needs to break free from the textbook format and inject some life into their writing. The key is to **show, don't tell**, and to create a narrative that resonates with the reader.
